Why do the electric field lines not form closed loops? (Comptt. All India 2012)
<br>
<br>
Answer: 
<div class="answer">
    <p>
        Electric field lines do not form closed loops because the direction of an electric field is from positive to negative charge. So one can regard a line of force starting from a positive charge and ending on a negative charge. This indicates that electric field lines do not form closed loops.

<p>
Question 23.
<br>
Why are electric field lines perpendicular at a point on an equipotential surface of a conductor? (Comptt. All India 2015)
<br>
<br>
Answer: 
<div class="answer">
    <p>
        If the electric field lines were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would have a non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to be done which means this surface cannot be equipotential surface.
        Hence, electric field lines are perpendicular at a point on an equipotential surface of a conductor.

Question 30.
<br>
Derive an expression for the torque experienced by an electric dipole kept in a uniform electric field. (Delhi 2017)

Answer: 
<div class="answer">
    <p>
        Consider an electric dipole consisting of charges + q and – q and of length 2a placed in a uniform electric field E→ making an angle θ with it. It has a dipole moment of magnitude
 <img src="/physics//Notes/q12.png" alt="" srcset="">
 Hence the net translating force on a dipole in a uniform electric field is zero. But the two equal and opposite forces act at different points of the dipole. They form a couple which exerts a torque.
Torque = Either force × Perpendicular distance between the two forces
x = qE × 2a sin θ
X = pE sin θ [ ∵ p = q × 2a; p is dipole moment]
As the direction of torque τ⃗  is perpendicular to p⃗  and E⃗ , so we can write τ⃗ =p⃗ ×E→

A thin straight infinitely long conducting wire having charge density X is enclosed by a cylindrical surface of radius r and length l, its axis coinciding with the length of the wire. Find the expression for the electric flux through the surface of the cylinder. (All India 2011)
<br>
<br>
Answer: 
<div class="answer">
    <p>
        Since the field is everywhere radial, flux through the two ends of the cylindrical Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical part of the surface, E is normal to the surface at every point, and its magnitude is constant, since it depends only on r. The surface area of the curved part is 2πrl, where l is the length of the cylinder.

        Given : E→=5×103i^N/C
        A = 10 × 10 × 10-4m2,
        Flux (ϕ) = EA cos θ

    (b) Consider two hollow concentric spheres, S1 and S2, enclosing charges 2Q and 4Q respectively as shown in the figure.

(ii) How will the electric flux through the sphere S1 change if a medium of dielectric constant ‘εr‘ is introduced in the space inside S1, in place of air? Deduce the necessary expression. (All India 2014)

<br>
<br>
Answer: 
<div class="answer">
    <p>
        (a) Torque on electric dipole. Consider an electric dipole consisting of two equal and opposite point charges separated by a small distance 2a having dipole moment
        <br>
 <img src="/physics//Notes/q97.png" alt="" srcset="">
 <br>
 So net force on the dipole is zero
 
 <br>
 Since <img src="/physics//Notes/q53.png" alt="" srcset=""> is uniform, hence the dipole does not undergo any translatory motion.
 <br>
 These forces being equal, unlike and parallel, from a couple, which rotates the dipole in clock-wise direction
 ∴ Magnitude of torque = Force × arm of couple
 <br>
 <img src="/physics//Notes/q98.png" alt="" srcset="">
 <br>
 [The direction of τ⃗  is given by right hand screw rule and is normal to p⃗   ] and E⃗ 
 Special cases
 (i) when θ = 0 then τ = PE sin θ = 0
 ∴ Torque is zero and the dipole is in stable equilibrium
 (ii) When θ = 90 then τ = PE sin 90 = PE
 ∴ The Torque is maximum
 (b) Ratio of flux
 <br>
 <img src="/physics//Notes/q99.png" alt="" srcset="">
