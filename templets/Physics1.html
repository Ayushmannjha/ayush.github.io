    Question 1. <br>
    A 500 µC charge is at the centre of a square of side 10 cm. Find the work done in moving a charge of 10 µC between two diagonally opposite points on the square. (Delhi 2008)
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
   <div class="answer"><p> The work done in moving a charge of 10 µC between two diagonally opposite points on the square will be zero because these two points will be at equipotential</p></div>
   
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     <p>
    Question 2. <br>
    What is the electrostatic potential due to an electric dipole at an equatorial point? (All India 2009)
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
   <div class="answer"><p> Electric potential at any point in the equatorial plane of dipole is Zero.</p></div>
    
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     <p>
    Question 3. <br>
    What is the work done in moving a test charge q through a distance of 1 cm along the equatorial axis of an electric dipole? (All India 2009))
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
   <div class="answer"><p> Since potential for equatorial axis
       <br>
    V = 0
    <br>
    ∴ W = qV = 0</p></div>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     <p>
    Question 4. <br>
    Define the term ‘potential energy’ of charge ‘q’ at a distance V in an external electric field. (All India 2009)
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
   <div class="answer"><p> It is defined as the amount of work done in bringing the charge from infinity to its position in the system in the electric field of another charge without acceleration.
       <br>
    V = Er.</p></div>
   
</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
     <p>
    Question 5. <br>
    A point charge Q is placed at point O as shown in the figure. Is the potential difference VA – VB positive, negative or zero, if Q is
    <br>
(i) positive
<br>
(ii) negative? (Delhi 2011)
<br>
<img src="/physics/Notes/r1.png" alt="" srcset="">
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
   <div class="answer"><p> Clearly,
       <br>
       <img src="/physics/Notes/r2.png" alt="">
       <br>
       As OA < OB, so the quantity within bracket is negative.
       <br>
       (i) If q is positive charge, VA – VB = negative
       <br>
   (ii) If q is negative charge, VA – VB = positive

    Question 6. <br>
    A hollow metal sphere of radius 5 cm is charged such that the potential on its surface is 10 V. What is the potential at the centre of the sphere?
    (All India 2011)
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
   <div class="answer"><p> The electric field inside the shell is zero. This implies that potential is constant inside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell) and, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is 10 V.

</p></div>
   
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    Question 7. <br>
    Why is electrostatic potential constant throughout the volume of the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on its surface? (Delhi 2012)
    <br>
    <br>
    Answer:
    <br>
    <div class="answer">
        <p> 
            Electric field inside the conductor = 0
